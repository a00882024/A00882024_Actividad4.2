## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Run Pylint

```bash
pylint src/ tests/
```

## P1 Compute Statistics

Run with one or more data files (one number per line):

```bash
python -m src.compute_statistics <filepath1> [filepath2] ...
```

Example:

```bash
python -m src.compute_statistics data/file1.txt data/file2.txt
```

Results are saved to `results/p1/StatisticsResults.txt`.

### Design Decisions

**File naming (`compute_statistics.py` vs `computeStatistics.py`):**

The script is named `compute_statistics.py` using snake_case instead of `computeStatistics.py` (camelCase) to comply with PEP8 naming conventions. PEP8 specifies that module names should be lowercase with underscores (snake_case). Since Req8 requires PEP8 compliance, we prioritize this standard Python convention.

**File location (`src/` folder):**

The script is located in the `src/` folder rather than the project root to follow standard Python project organization practices. This separation:
- Keeps source code organized and separate from configuration files, tests, and documentation
- Makes the codebase easier to maintain and navigate
- Allows for proper module imports between source files
- Follows common Python project structure conventions

The script can still be executed from the command line using `python -m src.compute_statistics`.

### Screenshots

Screenshots demonstrating the script execution:

- **Data folder structure** - Shows the input data files using `ls` command

- **Data tree view** - Displays the directory structure of the data folder
  ![data-tree](results/p1/data-tree.png)

- **Processing all files** - Demonstrates running the script with all test case files (TC1-TC7)
  ![process-all-files](results/p1/process-all-files.png)

- **Processing single file** - Shows the output when processing only TC1.txt

### Result Files

Output files generated by the compute_statistics script:

- [StatisticsResults.txt](results/p1/StatisticsResults.txt) - Statistics for all test cases (TC1-TC7) including count, mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and execution time
- [StatisticsResults-TC1.txt](results/p1/StatisticsResults-TC1.txt) - Statistics for a single test case (TC1) with 400 data points
